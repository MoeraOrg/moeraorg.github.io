# Node Name

Node name is registered at the [naming service][1]. Currently, Moera
supports only *registered names* (you may [read about them][1] in the
Overview section), but there are many other [name types][2] possible.
Every name type has a unique syntax that distinguishes it from others.

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Syntax</th>
         </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Registered name</td>
            <td>
                <code>&lt;name&gt;_&lt;generation&gt;</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
