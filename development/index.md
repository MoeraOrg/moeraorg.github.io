# About The Guide

This Guide describes protocols and APIs used in Moera and internal
details of implementation of the Moera components. It may be used as
a reference.
 
Before reading this Guide, it is recommended to learn about Moera in
general, its principles and planned features in [Architecture Overview][1] section.
It is organized as an introductory tutorial.

**If you want to help with development, you are welcome!** There is a
lot of work for programmers, cryptographers, UX designers, documentation
writers, translators, alpha and beta testers and system administrators.

The development is taking place in [public repositories on GitHub][2]
under MoeraOrg organization. Feel free to fork them, use issue trackers
and send pull requests.

If you have a question or just want to talk, send me e-mail to 
[balu@moera.org](mailto:balu@moera.org).

I share my thoughts about Moera and the latest Moera news in [Telegram
channel][4].
