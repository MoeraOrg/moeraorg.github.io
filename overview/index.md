# Centralized vs. Decentralized

The World Wide Web was designed with decentralization in mind. One of
the core ideas was that every user, organization, project should have
their own site or page located anywhere in the Internet and linked with
other pages using hyperlinks. The term *home page* came to us from these
ancient times. But the period when users created their own home pages
and filled them with their own content was very short. Soon, they began
to use centralized services for this purpose: forums, portals, blogging
platforms and so on. Comparing to the handcrafted home pages, the
platforms have many advantages.

**Ease of use.** No more tricky HTML/CSS formatting and server
programming. You enter the text - and it becomes published, in a second.
You can concentrate on the content and leave programming to programmers.

**Uniform design.** No more wild colors, non-readable text and confusing
navigation. Simple and straightforward, the design allows to quickly
reach the information you need.

**Free of charge.** You don't need to pay for the service. Just register
and start using it. The platform makes profit from selling advertising
and optional services.

**Feedback.** Comments, likes, reposts, polls, private messages etc.

**Single sign on.** You don't need to register on every personal page to
leave a comment - your username and password need to be entered once and
used everywhere. And nowadays you can even login to a third-party site
with your Google/Facebook/Twitter credentials.

**Find friends.** Locate them by their username, real name, phone number
etc.

**Link friends.** Tag them on photos and mention in comments.

**Friend feed.** You can subscribe to your friends' updates and see
everything they publish on one page.

**Notifications.** Never miss a comment or a birthday.

**Groups, events, tags.** Everything related to a single topic in one
place. Create local communities with rules and moderation. Invite your
friends to a barbecue.

**Security.** Give view and editing rights for your posts for different
groups of users. Block spam and unpleasant persons.

But everything has a price. And placing all your content (very valuable
for you) on a centralized platform has many drawbacks that are inherent
to centralized systems.

**Censorship.**

**End of life.**

**Lack of features.**

**Vendor lock-in.**

**Limited access.**

**Annoying ads.**

**Feed composition.**
