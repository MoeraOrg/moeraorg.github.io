# Why is it called Moera?

![Moerae][1]
 
The idea was to name it after the ancient Greek [Moerae][2], that
controls the thread of life (the social network timeline) of every
mortal from birth to death. But this name is very popular, and all domain
names for Moerae or Moirai are already taken. So we deleted the last
letter and shortened it to Moera.

By coincidence, there is also the name of the suburb of Lower Hutt, Wellington,
New Zealand, that is, [according to the Urban Dictionary][3] "is known
for being a dangerous place". This is also a good analogy for a
decentralized, uncontrollable and censorship-free social network.
However, a dangerous place in New Zealand, I suspect, is much safer than
many places in other parts of the world :)

Moera logo is graffiti on a city wall that also presents a voice of
anarchy. It is written in [Vitruvian Man][4] font.
